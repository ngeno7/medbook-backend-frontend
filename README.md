## Frontend

I was not able to use angular but I am currently getting more hands on with it.

The frontend is based on Vuejs 3 and bootstrap 5.
The application is already compiled on the dist folder

    Using php, you can serve the file
```
php -S localhost:8080 -t dist
```

To compile the project resources use the following command:

Development version
```
npm run development
```
Production version
```
npm run production
```
